# ToDo for PyFiSync

Immediate To Do list

- [X] Add test of moving item into an exclusion
- [ ] Add test for `--no-backup` with sync. I think this doesn't work.

Medium:

- [ ] Adler32 implementation and testing

Distant ToDo list

- [X] Python3 support (should be very easy. `2to3` shows very few changes)
- [ ] PyPi listing with full installation
- [ ] Alternative backends
- [ ] Encrypted file store?
- [ ] Windows support via bash subsystem
